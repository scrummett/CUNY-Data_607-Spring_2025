## General
This repository is designed to facilitate code sharing and collaborative learning among the class. While all assignments must be submitted via Brightspace as per course instructions, this space serves as a hub for learning from and supporting your classmates. Think of the course material as a project in a real company, with our shared goal being to master the content and help each other succeed. This repository represents the centralized codebase, showcasing the collective work and achievements of the semester.

# Participation
Participation in this repository is mandatory. While each assignment is graded independently in Brightspace per the course syllabus, your final grade will include mandatory points for the following:

- **New Submission:** Submit at least one piece of new code to the repository. This can be one of your assignments shared with the class or a new piece of code you wish to contribute. Submissions must be functional R code.
- **Classmate Contribution:** Improve or modify code already in the repository. Work on a classmate’s code and contribute your changes back to the repository.

# Privacy
Please note that this is a public repository, accessible to anyone on the internet. Do not upload any PII (Personally Identifiable Information), private data, data without public licenses, or data you do not own. Uploading data to this repository does not alter its licensing or grant any new permissions.

# Repo use
To use this public repository, follow these steps:     
- **Fork the Repository:**
    - Start by forking the repository to create your own local copy.
Work Locally: Perform the work you wish to share with the class in your forked repository.
- **Submit a Pull Request (PR):**
    - When ready to share, submit a PR to the main branch, which is the only branch we will be using.
    - Your instructor will review the PR, contact you if needed, and approve it to make the changes available to the entire class.
- **Sync with the Class Repository:**
    - Because you are working on your fork, your forked repository and the class repository may become out of sync.
    - To resolve this, perform a pull to bring changes from the class repository back into your forked repository.

# Commit message guidelines
All commit messages must follow this format:    
[Your First Initial + Last Name][New (for new code) or Update (for changes to existing code)][Description of the Commit]    
Examples:
- **New Code:**
PKowalchuk_New_titanic-EDA
- **Update:**
PKowalchuk_Update_titanic-survival-plots

# Pull Request (PR) Title
All pull request (PR) titles must follow the same guidelines as commit messages.

# Repo access
This repository will remain public throughout the semester.    
- **No Contributor Access:**
You will not be granted direct contributor access to the repository during the semester.
- **Pull Request (PR) Process:**
Since we are using GitHub's free version outside of an organization, it is not possible to enforce rules for committing directly to the main branch. To minimize potential errors, all code must be submitted via a PR from a fork.
- **End of Semester:**
At the end of the semester, the repository will be made private.
If you wish to maintain access to the repository, notify the instructor during the last week of class and provide your GitHub username to be added as a contributor.
